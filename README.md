# Space Ark Constructor
Space Ark Constructor is an in-development CLI and Web application to build ships for my [SPACE ARK miniature skirmish wargame](https://ryanlaliberty.itch.io/space-ark). It is meant as a replacement of the current [SPACE ARK Ship Builder] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gFEB0nsJ_nbAZvH3rNx8fDrZaWCASOcdjBhYto1-SyE/edit?gid=1120119713#gid=1120119713) Google Sheet.
